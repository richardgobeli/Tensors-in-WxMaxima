# Tensors-in-WxMaxima
There is a collection of many different GR and Tensor exploring worksheets here.   
Work is in progress on adding more worksheets.
- ivary.mac or ivary.wxm is a work sheet showing how to generate tensor variation and Euler-Lagrange Equation.
- Hagihara Coframe.mac shows how to find the frame for a equatorial cicular orbit around a body of mass m.  
   The wxm form of the file has question in the file that causes command line maxima to abort.
